# ðŸ§­ JobMatch - User Journey

## Phase 1 - Resume Optimization 
- Landing Page
- Get user input (resume upload + target title/role/job)
- Parse and get all the required attribute from the user data.
- Analysis the resume, run heuristic checks, generate scores and their corresponding feedbacks, showcase them to the user.
(Should i ask the user, whether or not to enhance the user? maybe an auto-optimize button?)
- Enhance all resume, based on the generated feedbacks, rewrite and improve all the necessary content, complying with the feedbacks gathered earlier.
- With the updated resume attributes, render it into a clean, elegant, ATS-friendly, common, universal format. I found an awesome [tool](https://rendercv.com/) and it python [package](https://rendercv.com/) too
